## Project Workflows

Here's how the project breaks down into workflows, with specific tasks, tools etc:

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

*   **What You'll Learn:** How to gather, clean, and prepare large datasetsâ€”a must for Senior Data Scientists.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Scrape educational content (e.g., course descriptions) using BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.
    *   Clean data (handle missing values, normalize text) with Pandas.
    *   Scale processing with Dask or Apache Spark for big data.
*   **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Dask, PostgreSQL (storage).
*   **Purpose:** To explain how we can handle messy data or scale preprocessing for millions of records.

### 2. Model Development

*   **What You'll Learn:** Building and optimizing advanced ML models, a core skill for top-tier roles.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create a recommendation system (e.g., matrix factorization) using Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
    *   Integrate an LLM (e.g., Hugging Face's transformers) to generate quizzes or summaries.
    *   Tune models with Optuna for better performance.
*   **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Hugging Face.
*  **Purpose:** To explain how we can Discuss model selection, trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. accuracy), and hyperparameter tuning.

### 3. Model Evaluation and Validation

*   **What You'll Learn:** Rigorous testing and validation to ensure model reliability.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Use cross-validation and precision@K for recommendations.
    *   Evaluate LLM output with BLEU or human-like quality checks.
    *   Log experiments with MLflow.
*   **Tools:** Scikit-learn, MLflow, custom metrics.
*   **Purpose:** To Explain how we validate models and address overfitting or data bias.

### 4. Deployment

*   **What You'll Learn:** Deploying models at scale, a key expectation for senior roles.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Build a FastAPI endpoint to serve predictions.
    *   Containerize with Docker and deploy on AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform.
    *   Handle real-time requests with low latency.
*   **Tools:** FastAPI, Docker, AWS/GCP.
*   **Purpose:** To Talk about scalability, latency optimization, and production challenges.

### 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

*   **What You'll Learn:** Keeping models performant over time, critical for production systems.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Monitor with Prometheus and visualize with Grafana.
    *   Automate retraining using Airflow.
    *   Detect data drift with statistical tests.
*   **Tools:** Prometheus, Airflow, custom scripts.
*   **Purpose:** To Describe how we detect and fix model degradation.
